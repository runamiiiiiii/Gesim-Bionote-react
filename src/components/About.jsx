        I am a 3rd-year student at Cebu Technological University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I live in Poblacion, Dalaguete, Cebu, and I was born on March 29, 2005. My favorite color is blue. I am passionate about technology and programming, and I enjoy exploring new software and learning new skills to enhance my knowledge in the field. In my free time, I like reading, listening to music, and spending time with family and friends.
